Ingredients
For the lasagna:

    12 whole grain lasagna noodles
    1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
    1 medium zucchini, chopped (optional)
    8oz pkg sliced mushrooms
    12oz pkg frozen spinach, thawed
    1 cup frozen peas, thawed (optional)
    5-10 cups marinara sauce (I like mine saucy!)

For the tofu ricotta:

    2-14oz pkg extra firm tofu, drained and pressed
    10oz tub roasted garlic hummus (1 heaping cup)
    ½ cup nutritional yeast
    ¼ cup fresh basil, finely chopped (optional)
    1 tsp salt
    1 tsp garlic powder

Instructions

    Preheat oven to 350F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add noodles and cook just until al dente. Drain and rinse with cold water.
    Meanwhile, heat oil over medium heat in a large skillet. Once hot, add zucchini, mushrooms, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Sauté for 5 minutes or until softened. Add spinach and peas and sauté for another 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat.
    Place drained tofu in a large bowl. Crumble with hands. Add hummus, nutritional yeast, basil, salt, and garlic powder. Stir together with your hands until it's semi-smooth and resembles ricotta.
    Place about 1½ cups of marinara in the bottom of a 9x13in baking dish. Top with 4 noodles (3 lengthwise and 1 widthwise to cover the gap at the end). Next add half of the ricotta mixture and half of the vegetable mixture. Top with a heaping 1½ cups or more of sauce. Repeat with more noodles, tofu mixture, and veggies. Then top with one last layer of noodles and another 1½ cups or more of sauce; I went heavy on the sauce because I love sauce! Top with a sprinkle of nutritional yeast.
    Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes.
