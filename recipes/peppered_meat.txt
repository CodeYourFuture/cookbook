Recipe for Nigerian Peppered meat
Ingredients:

1kg Assorted Meats
5 Red Bell Peppers
4 Big Tomatoes
2.5 Onions
2 Scotch Bonnet 
140g Tomato Purée
1 Cup Vegetable Oil
4 Knorr Chicken Cubes
1 Teaspoon chicken/beef seasoning of your choice
1 Teaspoon Curry
1 teaspoon Thyme
1 inch Ginger
4 Garlic cloves Minced
Salt to taste

Preparation:
Boil your meats with Garlic, Ginger, Onion, Bouillon Cubes, Curry and Salt to taste. When it’s boiled, grill or deep fry and set aside. Ignore the Chicken in the photo, decided to kill two birds with one stone, the assorted meats are on the second shelf…
Roughly blend or grind your Peppers, Tomatoes, Ginger and 1,5 Onions with as little water as possible and set aside…
Pour the blended Pepper and minced Garlic into a big pot, place on medium heat, then boil down for 10 minutes…
While that’s boiling, get another pot, add the Vegetable Oil, place on low to medium heat, when it’s hot, add 1 chopped onion, fry the Onions for 5 minutes or until it begins to caramelise…
Then add the Tomato Purée, fry till the purée loses its sourness and begins to taste sweet. You’ll need to taste the Purée every now and then to make sure it’s sweetened, this should take roughly 8 minutes…
Check on the Pepper, when it is cooked down….
Add the Fried Purée along with the Onions, then add the Curry, Thyme, Bouillon cubes and Seasoning.
Combine and continue to fry for 5 minutes….
Now, add the Fried or Grilled Meats and combine. Turn the heat down to low and continue to fry for 5 minutes….
For a deeper and richer flavour, let the meats soak in the stew for as long as possible before serving….Enjoy!
