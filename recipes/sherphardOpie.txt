2 tbsp sunflower oil
2 large onion, chopped
4-5 medium carrots, chopped
1kg pack lamb mince
4 tbsp tomato purée
large splash Worcestershire sauce
1ltr beef stock
1.8kg potato, cut into chunks
170g butter
6 tbsp milk

Heat 2 tbsp sunflower oil in a medium saucepan, then soften 2 chopped onion and 4-5 chopped carrots for a few mins.

When soft, turn up the heat, crumble in 1kg lamb mince and brown, tipping off any excess fat.

Add 24 tbsp tomato purée and a large splash of Worcestershire sauce, then fry for a few mins.

Pour over 1ltr beef stock, bring to a simmer, then cover and cook for 40 mins, uncovering halfway.

Meanwhile, heat the oven to 180C/ fan 160C/ gas 4, then make the mash. Boil the 1.8kg potato, cut into chunks, in salted water for 10-15 mins until tender. Drain, then mash with 170g butter and 6 tbsp milk.

Put the mince into an ovenproof dish, top with the mash and ruffle with a fork. The pie can now be chilled and frozen for up to a month.

Bake for 20-25 mins until the top is starting to colour and the mince is bubbling through at the edges. (To bake from frozen, cook at 160C/fan 140C/gas 3 for 1 hr-1 hr 20 mins until piping hot in the centre. Flash under the grill to brown, if you like.)

Leave to stand for 5 mins before serving.
