Method

    Bring a pan of salted water to the boil. Add the eggs and simmer for 7 mins. Remove with a slotted spoon and pop in a bowl of ice-cold water. Once cool, gently peel the shell off the eggs and set aside.

    Place the bacon on a baking tray lined with foil. Pop under the grill set on high and cook on each side for 4-5 mins or until super-crispy. Leave to cool a little.

    Whisk together the olive oil, vinegar and mustard with a good pinch of sugar until thick and glossy. Season generously.

    Remove the outer leaves of the lettuces and slice each one in half lengthways. Divide between two deep bowls and add the avocado, tomatoes and chicken. Top with the crispy bacon and halved soft-boiled eggs, drizzle over the vinaigrette and grind over some black pepper.
