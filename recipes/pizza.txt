Ingredients
1-1/2 to 1-3/4 cups white whole wheat flour
1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon each dried basil, oregano and parsley flakes
3/4 cup beer or nonalcoholic beer
TOPPINGS:
1-1/2 teaspoons olive oil
1 garlic clove, minced
2 cups shredded Italian cheese blend
2 cups fresh baby spinach
1 can (14 ounces) water-packed quartered artichoke hearts, drained and coarsely chopped
2 medium tomatoes, seeded and coarsely chopped
2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh basil
Directions
Preheat oven to 425Â°. In a large bowl, whisk 1-1/2 cups flour, baking powder, salt and dried herbs until blended. Add beer, stirring just until moistened.
Turn dough onto a well-floured surface; knead gently 6-8 times, adding additional flour if needed. Press dough to fit a greased 12-in. pizza pan. Pinch edge to form a rim. Bake 8 minutes or until edge is lightly browned.
Mix oil and garlic; spread over crust. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup cheese; layer with spinach, artichoke hearts and tomatoes. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake 8-10 minutes or until crust is golden and cheese is melted. Sprinkle with fresh basil.
