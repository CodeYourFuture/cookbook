Smoky Mexican chicken traybake

Loaded with mouthwatering Mexican flavours, this smoky traybake is perfect for spicing up your midweek meals. Serve with a dollop of soured cream, fragrant coriander and creamy guacamole for a dish that will have people fighting for seconds.

    Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Slash the skin of each thigh and drumstick 2-3 times. Place in a large greased roasting tray with the peppers and red onion.
    Mix together the tinga paste and barbecue sauce. Spoon over the chicken and vegetables and toss well to ensure everything is coated. Roast for 15 mins, then add the sweet potato. Carefully turn and baste everything in the juices and cook for a further 25-30 mins until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender and starting to char. Remove from the oven and gently turn the vegetables again in the juices.
    Serve straight from the roasting tray, with spoonfuls of soured cream, coriander leaves to garnish, and guacamole on the side.
