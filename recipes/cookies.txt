Preparation

    Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
    In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
    In a large bowl, beat together the butter, brown sugar, granulated sugar, and vanilla extract until smooth.
    Add the eggs one at a time, beating as you go.
    Add the flour mixture a bit at a time while beating, until it forms a smooth dough.
    Add the pretzels to a zip-top bag and crush with a rolling pin.
    Fold in the chocolate chips and crushed pretzels until evenly combined.
    Press a caramel flat and place in the middle of a ball of dough, about 2 tablespoons.
    Fold the dough around the caramel, using a bit more to seal if necessary. Place on a well-greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.
    Bake for 8-10 minutes, then remove from the oven.
    While still warm, press a single pretzel into the top of each cookie. Serve with a cold glass of milk or on their own!
    Enjoy!
